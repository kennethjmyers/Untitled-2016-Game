# Untitled Unity Game

This is a unity game I was creating as a side project while in between jobs in 2016. I had some videos of my development on youtube and another user asked if I could upload my scripts.

I will work on putting a license in here but for now if you use any of my work please just credit me, "Kenneth Myers", if you publish it.
